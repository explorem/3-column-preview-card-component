## My process

In this project, I practiced using flexbox. I also added an animation.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've learned to understand flexbox better. I used the flex-direction change for responsiveness.

### Continued development

In future projects, I will use more animations and advanced CSS features such as grid.
